# Collibra Scripts
Scripts (mostly Python) for automating tasks with the Collibra API.

These scripts use the REST API for [https://www.collibra.com/](Collibra) to do some easily automated tasks.  They aren't entirely generic, but they provide a good example of how to use Python to interact with Collibra's API.  If you have access to the Collibra software, you can also download the full documentation on their REST API.
